## PR-B5: Bowling + KBF into Unified BookingFlow (IN PROGRESS — 2026-05-28)
- **Branch:** `feat/booking-b2-race` @ `9d127c90` · merged with main 2026-05-28
- **What shipped (all build-verified):**
  - D1: Type extensions — BowlingItem/KbfItem with 30+ fields, LoyaltyState on BookingSession, 5 new reducer actions
  - D2: Bowling service — `service/bowling.ts` (hold/confirm/cancel/reserve) wired into `getService()`
  - D3: 7 bowling step components — Players, Slots, Tier, Offer (QAMF hold), Shoes, Attractions, Food
  - D4: 2 KBF steps — KbfIdentity (lookup→OTP→verify), KbfBowlers (family member selection)
  - D5: Hold timer generalized — ReservationTimer handles BMI + QAMF with 8-min auto-extend
  - D6: Checkout bowling path → `bowlingReserve()` → `/api/bowling/v2/reserve`
  - D6b: Shared HeadPinz Loyalty — LoyaltySection at checkout for ALL HeadPinz bookings (earning + redeeming)
  - D7: Step registry — all bowling/kbf placeholders replaced with real components
  - D8: Deposit unification — bowling reserve uses `createDepositAndCharge()`, same as race/attraction
  - D9: DiscountCodeInput on bowling slots step
- **Still needs before go-live:**
  - Smoke test with QAMF staging + Square sandbox
  - BowlingOfferStep line-item building refinement (v1 handles duration multipliers, per-lane scaling, combo items)
  - BowlingSlotsStep needs HP_LOCATIONS integration (static fallback hours currently)
  - BowlingAttractionsStep needs real BMI slot-booking (shows "Coming soon" placeholder)
  - CheckoutStep bowling review needs proper line-item names from Square products (currently synthetic)
  - Loyalty `resolveAudienceMember()` at checkout for squareCustomerId earning on race/attraction orders
  - v2 reserve route needs squareCustomerId + loyalty reward params for non-bowling bookings

## SEO: HeadPinz metadata on shared /book routes
- **Priority:** High
- **Issue:** `headpinz.com/book/*` pages show FastTrax title/description in Google results because `/book` routes use the root layout metadata (FastTrax-branded), not the `/hp` layout
- **Root cause:** Middleware line 69 excludes `/book` from the `/hp` rewrite, so shared booking pages inherit the root `app/layout.tsx` metadata
- **Fix:** Use `generateMetadata` in `/book` pages that reads the `x-brand` header (set by middleware) to return HeadPinz or FastTrax metadata dynamically
- **Files:** `app/layout.tsx`, `app/book/[attraction]/page.tsx`, `app/book/race/page.tsx`, `middleware.ts`
- **Google result example:** `headpinz.com/book/gel-blaster` shows "Indoor Go-Kart Racing & Entertainment | Fort Myers, FL" and "63000 sq ft of high-performance electric go-kart racing..."
