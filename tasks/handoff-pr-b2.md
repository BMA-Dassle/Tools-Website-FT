## 1. Where racing is right now

The race wizard at `/book/race/v2` walks end-to-end:

1. **Party** — per-member roster; ExperiencePicker (new vs returning); ReturningRacerLookup with phone/email/code + OTP; Pandora-linked family members
2. **Date** — per-month BMI availability fetch; group event blocker; Mega Tuesday + new juniors banner; legend with Private Event chip
3. **Adult Race** + **Junior Race** — tier-grouped picker, tier descriptions, TrackPickerModal for multi-track packs, Premium Packages (Rookie Pack + Ultimate Qualifier variants), Adult/Junior category banner when party has both
4. **Adult Heats** + **Junior Heats** — per-racer assignment via RacerSelectorModal, conflict gating (Red 13 / Blue 16 / Mega 13 / cross-track 30 min), 75-min lead time for new racers, locked-track filter from package picks, private event guard, reminders pane
5. **POV & Pack** — Rookie Pack chooser (gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOKIE_PACK_ENABLED`) OR v1's qty stepper for existing racers
6. **Extras** — 4 BMI add-ons (Shuffly / Duckpin / Gel Blaster / Laser Tag) with SMS-Timing dayplanner scheduling + race-heat conflict + cross-building 30-min buffer
7. **Cart** — rich preview showing actual product name + track + per-heat racer assignments + extras + estimated total; LeaveConfirmModal on "All activities" so customers don't accidentally destroy session
8. **Checkout** — 6 phases (contact → booking → review → paying → confirming → redirect); Square Web Payments SDK; Square saved cards for returning customers; clickwrap row write
9. **Confirmation** — reuses v1's shared `/book/confirmation` page via compat path (v2 writes to `/api/booking-store` Redis + `/api/booking-record` 90d). SMS / email / sales_log fire through v1 infra automatically.

Every step renders **real BMI / SMS-Timing / Pandora / Square data**. No mock mode. License auto-sells for new racers via BMI `booking/sell`. POV qty sells against the POV SKU. Add-ons sell against their BMI productIds. Discount codes apply at Square via the existing `/api/square/pay`.

## 2. The 5 commits since the 05-21 handoff (most recent first)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `d120b614` | **PR-B2.5: session persistence, cross-sell nav, timer expiry, floating cart** — `usePersistedReducer` hook wraps useReducer with sessionStorage (SSR-safe: starts with fallback, hydrates via `useEffect` + `restoreSession` action, returns `[session, dispatch, hydrated]`). Cross-sell: BookingFlow detects incoming activity not in cart and adds it on hydrated mount. ReservationTimer exposes `refresh()` via forwardRef/useImperativeHandle; new ReservationExpiredModal (blocking modal with Extend/Start Over). MiniCartV2 floating cart button on `/book/v2` landing page reads sessionStorage. CartView LeaveConfirmModal no longer clears session — copy updated to "progress is saved." CheckoutStep calls `clearBookingSession()` before redirects. |
| `9d3e3b66` | **a11y fixes + non-compounding cross-building buffer** — postbuild a11y gate passing, conflict buffer fix |
| `8a280dba` | **v1 wording parity** — ExperiencePicker port (heading, longer descriptions, "What to expect" callout), drop duplicate "Welcome to FastTrax" wrapper, license reminder verbatim ("per driver applies at first check-in"), Checkout heading "Checkout" + "Enter your details to complete booking." |
| `acddc026` | **packageId tracking** — `RaceItem.packageId` persists Premium Package selection; saveBookingDetails forwards under `package` key to `/api/booking-record`; v1 confirmation page passes it to `/api/notifications/booking-confirmation` → `sales_log.package_id`. Also fixed back-nav state loss for package picks. |
| `3dae7b53` | **Rich cart preview + leave-confirmation modal** — CartView shows real product name + track + per-heat racer assignments + extras + estimated total (was "High-Speed Electric Racing" generic placeholder). LeaveConfirmModal on "All activities" link in CartView + BookingFlow when cart has items. Wizard header gets "Step N of M · Next: <step>" hint. |
| `007bc58c` | **6 bug fixes from user's Phase A walkthrough** — memberships pipe through PartyMember → filterProducts (unblocks 3-Pack / Intermediate / Pro for returning racers); RacePartyStep state derived from session.party (fixes back-nav reset); fetchBillOverview drops ghost lines + CheckoutStep review shows racer names per line; ReturningRacerLookup inputs wrapped in `<form onSubmit>` for Enter submit; adult/junior category banner; bookHeatsOnAdvance progress UI ("Reserving heat N of M…"). |
| `4709ebb0` | Progress marker doc (non-functional) |

(Plus the earlier huge commit `e2d5c37e` that shipped commits 10–14 in one push: checkout, confirmation compat, HeightAgeConfirmModal, BMI verification flow, Premium Packages, ReservationTimer.)

## 3. What's left for racing to ship

### Before flipping PR Draft → Ready

1. **Complete Phase A retest** — A6 (add-ons), A11 (reservation timer), A12 (error path), plus the side-effect block (Square sandbox shows charge, sales_log row appears, SMS + email send). Walk it at `http://localhost:3000/book/race/v2` after running `npm run dev -w fasttrax-web`. Update `tasks/pr-b2-e2e-verification-2026-05-24.md` with pass/fail per row.

2. **Verify v1 confirmation page reads `booking:${billId}` key** — v2's booking-store writes with a colon (`booking:${billId}`) instead of v1's underscore (`booking_{billId}`). Test by booking through to payment + landing on `/book/confirmation`. If the confirmation page can't find the booking, either rename the v2 key OR add a fallback read in the confirmation page. Check during A1 retest.

3. **Re-verify build** — `npx turbo run build --filter=fasttrax-web` should be clean. Last verified before the cart preview / wording commits.

4. **Open the GitHub PR** (if not already open) and paste body from `tasks/pr-b2-pr-description-2026-05-24.md`. Branch → base = `feat/booking-b2-race` → `feat/booking2`. Mark Draft until retest is done.

5. **Flip Draft → Ready** once retest is green. Add the three open questions from the PR description as inline comments or labels.

### Open questions (flagged in PR description, decisions needed)

1. **Selected `packageId` tracking** — DONE in commit `acddc026`. Was originally a follow-up; landed early.
2. **Booking-store key format** (`booking:${billId}` vs v1's `booking_{billId}`) — verify during A1 retest. If broken, rename or add fallback.
3. **Cross-session navigation** (cart joins existing session via cross-sell tile) — should PR-B2.5 land before PR-B3 (attractions), or after?

### Deferred (NOT in PR-B2 by design)

| Feature | Reason | Next PR |
|---|---|---|
| POV Pandora session linking (8s post-confirm scheduling) | Scope decision §2 | "Race video features" PR |
| BMI office notes (`appendPrivateNote` buffer) | Scope decision §6 — v1 endpoint pending confirmation | TBD |
| Cross-session navigation (cart joins existing session) | **DONE** in `d120b614` | Landed in PR-B2.5 |
| Race-pack credit purchases | Different model (credit not booking) | PR-B4 |
| Square Orders + Catalog adapter wiring (`data/square.ts`, `data/square-catalog.ts`) | Racing doesn't need them; checkout calls `/api/square/pay` directly. Bowling + attractions WILL need the catalog reader for `BMI Item ID` resolution | PR-B3 prerequisite |

## 5. Quick verification commands

```powershell
# Sanity check on resume
git fetch origin
git status   # expect clean
git log --oneline -5

# Run tests + typecheck
npx turbo run typecheck test --filter=fasttrax-web   # expect 313/313 passing

# Boot dev server
npm run dev -w fasttrax-web   # http://localhost:3000

# Build before flipping PR
npx turbo run build --filter=fasttrax-web   # ~1-2 min
```

Live BMI availability probe (sanity check that the proxy + adapter shape still work):
```powershell
$body = '{"ProductId":45094857,"PageId":25850629,"Quantity":1,"OrderId":null,"PersonId":null,"DynamicLines":[]}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/bmi?endpoint=availability&date=2026-05-23&clientKey=headpinzftmyers" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
# expect: { "proposals": [...] } or { "proposals": [] } for a date with no slots — both indicate the shape is correct
```

## 6. Architectural decisions locked for racing (don't relitigate)

1. **Multi-activity cart** — `BookingSession.items` holds N items; one Square Order anchors all
2. **One center per cart** — switching center clears items
3. **Brand = theming only** — `entryBrand` never mutates after session creation
4. **Per-member `isNewRacer`** — v2 chosen divergence from v1's party-wide `racerType`
5. **Multi-heat 3-Pack support** — `RaceItem.heats: RaceHeatAssignment[]`, one entry per (block × racer)
6. **No mock mode** — all BMI / Square / SMS-Timing / Pandora calls are real
7. **POV = flat qty SKU** — `RaceItem.povQuantity: number`, no per-racer attribution
8. **packageId persists on item** — for back-nav AND for sales_log via booking-record
9. **License auto-sells during BMI bookHeat** for new racers — no separate license picker step
10. **Cart line racer attribution** — heatId → party member name map built at render time in CheckoutStep review
11. **"All activities" link is confirmation-gated** when cart has items (LeaveConfirmModal). Leaving does NOT clear session — progress is saved.
12. **Booking-store key is `booking:${billId}`** (colon) — diverges from v1's `booking_{billId}` underscore. Compat with shared confirmation page is item 2 in § 3 to verify.
13. **Session persists in sessionStorage** — `usePersistedReducer` hook, SSR-safe hydration via `restoreSession` action. Survives tab close, refresh, cross-sell navigation. Cleared on checkout success and timer "Start Over."
14. **MiniCartV2 on landing page** — floating cart button reads sessionStorage, only visible on `/book/v2` when session has items

---

## 7. Known bugs (PR-B2.5)

| Bug | Severity | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **New racers can remove license from cart** | Medium | License auto-sells at checkout for `isNewRacer` members, but the cart UI's remove button lets customers delete the license line item. Need: guard cart remove for required/mandatory items, or hide the remove button on license lines. |

## 7b. Known v1 parity gaps deferred (will be in PR description)

| Gap | Where it lives in v1 | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| POV Pandora session linking | `app/book/race/page.tsx` | Scope decision §2 — separate video-features PR |
| BMI office notes (`appendPrivateNote`) | `lib/bmi-*` | Scope decision §6 — v1 endpoint pending confirmation |
| `sales_log` direct write from v2 | `lib/sales-log.ts` | Resolved via compat path — v1's confirmation handler fires `logSale()` automatically (verified in parity matrix #2.2) |

---

## 8. Quick architectural reference

- **Race wizard step order:** Party → Date → Adult Race → Adult Heats → Junior Race → Junior Heats → POV & Pack → Extras. Adult/Junior steps gated by `isVisible` based on party composition.
- **State machine:** `usePersistedReducer` in `BookingFlow.tsx`. Session state persisted to sessionStorage via `usePersistedReducer` hook (SSR-safe: hydrates post-mount via `restoreSession` action). Sessions survive tab close / refresh. `clearBookingSession()` wipes on checkout success or timer "Start Over."
- **Back-nav preservation:** the reducer NEVER destroys data on `back` — only the step cursor moves. Any state loss on back-nav is a step component bug (using `useState` instead of deriving from session) — see commit 007bc58c for the fix pattern.
- **Heat booking:** happens on Next from the heat-picker step (not at checkout). BMI orderId chains all heats. The reservation timer (10 min) ticks on the BMI bill once created.
- **Checkout:** `service/checkout.ts:runCheckout` orchestrates contact registration → bill overview → review → payment via shared `PaymentForm` (which calls `/api/square/pay`) → clickwrap → window.location to `/book/confirmation`.
- **Confirmation:** v1's shared page reads `/api/booking-store` (Redis 24h) + `/api/booking-record` (Postgres 90d), then POSTs to `/api/notifications/booking-confirmation` which fires SMS + email + `logSale()` + `clickwrap_acceptances`.

## 9. If something breaks during retest

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix location |
|---|---|---|
| Cart shows "High-Speed Electric Racing" again | CartView regressed | `src/components/features/booking/CartView.tsx:206` (RaceCartCard) |
| 3-Pack hidden for returning racer | memberships not flowing | `RacePartyStep.tsx:81` (handlePersonVerified) + `RaceProductStep.tsx:172` (memberships pass) |
| Back to Party shows ExperiencePicker again | local state regression | `RacePartyStep.tsx:28-32` (useState init from session.party) |
| Confirmation page can't find booking | booking-store key mismatch | Either `service/checkout.ts:saveBookingDetails` (write underscore key too) or `app/book/confirmation/page.tsx` (add fallback read) |
| Heat booking slow with no feedback | onProgress not threading | `service/race.ts:bookHeatsOnAdvance` signature + `BookingFlow.tsx:setBookingHeatsProgress` call |
| Square sandbox not charging | Shared `/api/square/pay` regressed | Read git log on `app/api/square/pay/route.ts` (refactored on main during merge window) |
| sales_log row missing for a v2 booking | booking-record body shape | `service/checkout.ts:saveBookingDetails` — must include `package`, `rookiePack`, `racers[]` |

## 10. Where to find help

- **Memory files** at `C:\Users\Alex.Trepasso\.claude\projects\c--git-Tools-Website-FT\memory\` — auto-loaded by Claude. `v1_race_parity_checklist.md` is the canonical v1 behavior list.
- **Lessons** at `tasks/lessons.md` — accumulated gotchas (BMI ID precision, husky corruption, etc.)
- **Project plan** at `tasks/restructure-plan.md` + status at `tasks/restructure-status.md`
- **Operating principles** in `CLAUDE.md` § 7

Stop and ask before:
- Touching any v1 file under `apps/web/app/book/race/` or `apps/web/lib/race-*`, `apps/web/lib/packages.ts`, `apps/web/lib/sales-log.ts`
- Force-pushing or rewriting pushed history on `feat/booking-b2-race`
- Modifying `/api/square/pay`, `/api/bmi`, `/api/sms` proxy routes — shared with v1
- Adding new env vars (need Vercel + 1Password updates too)
- Changing any of the 12 locked architectural decisions in § 6
